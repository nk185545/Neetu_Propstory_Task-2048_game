Step 1: You dynamically need to create the board (There should be an option to give N i.e. it could be 3x3, 4x4, or any number).

Step 2: At the start of the game, randomly place two 2's in any of squares. 

Step 3: And on pressing any of the arrow keys (up, down, left, right), you should move all of 2's in that direction. No need to combine 2's into 4's and further. Just on any arrow keypress, move all 2's in that direction and after that, randomly put one 2 in an empty box.

Step 4: Put one 2 in any empty box randomly

Step 5: The game is over when all boxes are filled.
